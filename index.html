             <p id="beginng" class="description">  I started learning about a couple of years , but until recently I started  <em>consistently </em> working on my practical skills. What have I been chasing is software development more specific web development . Even more specific I want to be proficient in front-end development then pursue mastery in back-end development. In my mind this path would be best for me ,because I get to know and understand the front-end aspects to better understand the role of the back-end development. My recent studies have been mostly html and css where I progressing to mastering . Once I have master those to languages then I will get comfortable with Javascript where I can make webpages/websites more interactive. Looking a head that sounds cool but first I need to familize myself with good practices with html and CSS . I have heard that clean descriptive code is almost praised ; so I trying to start good habits by doing this with html and CSS.

            <h3 id="rn-header" class="sub-header"> Where I'm at Right Now</h3>
            <p id="rn-paragraph" class="description"> Right now I using Khan Acadmey (mostly) and Freecodingcamp to help hone and develop my coding skills.This is not my first time with programming languages I learned python , but didn't really know how to use it outside basic programs (I didn't know about librariess at the time) . I did skip the Game development / simulations unit in KA , while skimming through I knew it wasn't my thing.I did do the html and css units along with  the JS animation and intro to SQL , and man the SQL syntax is hard for me and still is frankly (it was only a intro). My plan right now is to finish <em> Making Webpages interactive </em> and understand <strong>DOM</strong>  (I saw this a lot in reddit). Obviously right now I making a webpage right now to help me implement what I have learn , through KA does have challenges right after a walkthroughs which is wonderful for keeping that info in mind.

            <h3 id="html-header" class="sub-header">Html and CSS</h3>
            <p id ="html-paragraph" class="descripton">
                Html actually was pretty easy to pick up really once you memorize the tags it's creation at your fingertips.Now there are some tags that I saw but didn't really use : article , section , and script . I already know that script is tied with Javascript , so it will mostly come up in my current unit in making webpages interactive. I will say I saw lots of cool webpages using css (seemly withou JS) . What's cool is that you realize things about webpages and how they work . An example of this would be table of contents where it slides to your selected content I thought that was JS wizardly stuff but it's not just use a simple href to a ID.

        <div id="JS-div" class="section">
            <h3 id="JS-header" class="sub-header">Javascript and SQL</h3>
            <p class="description" id ="JS-paragraph"> Now Javascript I'm straight up not that good at. I mean I'm okay but I forget the syntax a lot and have some logical error here and there.I know if I put more time into it will probably get better but there still going to be frustion involved in learning. What I plan on doing with Javascript is get proficient then learns a framework like React or node (node sounds good because it supports Express for back-end). SQL I got a brief introdcution which was cool but it can be tough at times especially on large scale data sets. However, I know I wlll need SQL to get into the back-end. Javascript time will come just not right now I'm working on html and CSS.</p>

            <p id="ahead-paragraph" class="description">
                For the future I plan on going either the miliary or college (for Computer Science). I will continue my course of KA and the next one which is the same just with JQeury. After that I will start my Javascript joureny on <a>Freecodingcamp</a> where I will learn a <em>Real</em> programming languages. Thinking about I will probably add to this website with learning new things or just make small programs to implement what I have learned.
